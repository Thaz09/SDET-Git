[Intro]
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
(Vengaboys are back in town)
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh

[Verse 1]
If you're alone and you need a friend
Someone to make you forget your problems
Just come along, baby, take my hand
I'll be your lover tonight

[Refrain]
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
This is what I wanna do
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
(Let's have some fun)
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
One on one, just me and you
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh

[Chorus]
Boom, boom, boom, boom!!
I want you in my room
Let's spend the night together
From now until forever
Boom, boom, boom, boom!!
I wanna go boom boom
Let's spend the night together
Together in my room
